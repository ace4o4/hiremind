1. Executive Summary
The UI/UX of InterviewGuru follows “Calm Premium Minimalism with Subtle Liquid Glass” philosophy.

Interview Screen = Ultra-minimal, zero-distraction (real interview feel)
Dashboard, Setup, Report & Progress Hub = Premium, delightful, confidence-boosting
Overall feel: Premium like Linear + Arc + Calm, but with subtle 2026 liquid glass magic
Goal: Reduce interview anxiety by 70% while making every interaction feel rewarding and modern

This design system will make InterviewGuru look and feel visually superior to every competitor in 2026 while remaining highly usable.
Tagline for Design:
“Calm on the outside. Powerful on the inside.”

2. Design Principles

Minimal First – Less is more. Never add decoration that doesn’t serve a purpose.
Calm & Confident – Soft colors, generous space, smooth motion → zero anxiety.
Subtle Premium Magic – Light liquid glass, soft glows, gentle physics only where it adds delight.
Focus on User – During interview, 90% screen belongs to the user/avatar.
Consistency – Every screen follows the same visual language.
Delight without Distraction – Micro-animations are smooth, fast (≤300ms), and purposeful.

Liquid Glass

Base: #FFFFFF at 6–10% opacity
Border: 1px solid #FFFFFF at 15% opacity
Inner highlight: Soft teal gradient

Accents

Primary (Teal): #00E6C8 (Soft Ocean Teal) – buttons, progress, success
Secondary Glow: #A78BFA (Soft Lavender) – hover, panels, EQ tips
Success/Confidence: #34D399 (Jade Green)
Warning: #F87171 (Soft Red – very rare)

Text

Primary: #F1F5F9
Secondary/Muted: #94A3B8
All text has 0.5px soft glow for premium feel

States

Hover/Focus: +12px soft teal glow + slight scale (1.02)
Active/Success: Jade green glow + micro particle burst (only on high scores)


4. Typography

Headings: Satoshi (Variable) – weights 500, 700
Body: Inter (Variable) – weights 400, 500
Sizes:
H1: 42px (Dashboard hero)
H2: 28px
Body: 16px
Small: 14px

Line height: 1.6

5. Core Visual Elements

Liquid Glass Cards:
Backdrop blur: 24px
Border radius: 20px
Subtle inner refraction (CSS + light WebGL where possible)
No heavy liquid flow – only gentle shimmer on hover/scroll

Soft Glow System:
All interactive elements: 8–12px soft glow
Glow color matches primary accent
Glow intensity increases with user score (report screen)

2D Scrolling Physics:
Smooth inertia + natural bounce (Lenis + Framer Motion)
Cards tilt 2–4° based on scroll velocity
Parallax layers: background moves 30% slower

Micro-animations:
All transitions: 180–300ms, cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)
Hover: scale + glow + liquid ripple from cursor
Success: soft jade particle burst (10–15 particles, fade out)
